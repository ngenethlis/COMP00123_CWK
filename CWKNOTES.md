# Complex Networks Coursework


## CWK Instructions

__Good Network science related questions__:

- Specific, describable in few sentences
- Answer shouldn't be unknown
- Answer must be meaningful and valuable
- Must study a network and apply network science methods to find answer

__Before you start__:
- Formulation stage: what kind of network data is needed, what type of analysis and how much is needed
- COnduct lit survey on research question so you can borrow ideas and compare results
- Propose set of specific tasks that you aim to accomplish to obtain an answer to your research question
- After finishing work, write and submit a project report


__ADVICE__

- You should focus on (1) formulation of research question and design of project, (2)
quantitative analysis, and (3) evaluation and discussion of your results.
- Comparative analysis is always helpful, for example comparison between two networks,
comparison between a real network and its randomised graphs, and comparison between
results from different methods.
- Important advice: This is a coursework, not an MSc project. Thus, when you plan your
coursework, please be realistic and make sure you can finish your work and write your
report before the deadline. An over-ambitious project brings trouble to yourself.
- Ideally, networks with 500 ~ 50k nodes containing <5% of possible links. A
network must have at least 150 nodes to allow a meaningful staEsEcal
analysis; and not more than 200k which can slow down your calculation.
- You should always exam the basic properEes of your network, such as degree
distribuEon, average shortest path length, mixing paLern etc, which can help
you and readers to make sense of the network.


__Submission related__

    2. Abstract (half page)

- Research Question 2-3 pages:
    1. Introduce network
    2. Introduce question
    3. Why this question
        - Has it been studied? If yes what is unique about your project
        - Why is it interesting and valuable
        - Why is it suitable for network-science analysis

- Lit survey 1-3 pages:
    1. Introduce and discuss about 3-5 relevant research works.
    2. Why are they relevant, what did I learn / borrow from them and limitations/problems

- Methodology 1-3 pages:
    1. Describe network data:
        - how/where they are collected. What
        - what are nodes and links
        - basic properties
        - if own data collection provide details so that others can reproduce

    2. Explain methods/algorithms/tools used, similarly enough info so that it's reproducable
